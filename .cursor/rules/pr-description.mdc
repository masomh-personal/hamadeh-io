# PR Title & Description Generator

When the user asks to "create PR title and description" (or similar), do the following — no fluff, output in markdown for copy/paste.

## Steps

1. Run `git fetch origin develop main` to ensure refs are current.
2. Run `git log origin/main..origin/develop --oneline` to get all commits.
3. Run `git diff origin/main...origin/develop --stat` to get changed files.

## Output format

Produce exactly this — nothing before or after:

```
## PR Title

\`\`\`
<concise conventional-commit-style title>
\`\`\`

## PR Description

\`\`\`markdown
## Summary
- <bullet per logical change group, no filler>

## Changes

### <Type> (e.g. Features, Bug Fixes, Refactoring, Styles)
- <scope if any>: <description>

## File Changes
\`\`\`
<git diff --stat output>
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
```

## Rules

- Title must be conventional-commit style: `type: short imperative summary` or `type/type: ...` for mixed batches.
- Group commits by conventional type (feat → Features, fix → Bug Fixes, refactor → Refactoring, style → Styles, docs → Documentation, chore → Chores).
- Omit any section with no commits of that type.
- No marketing language, no "this PR", no "I", no filler.
- Keep each bullet under one line.
- The file changes block uses the raw `--stat` output verbatim.
