# Problem

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
```

## Solution

### Approach: Hash Map

The key insight is to use a hash map to store each number and its index as we iterate through the array. For each number, we check if its complement (target - current number) exists in the hash map.

```typescript
function twoSum(nums: number[], target: number): number[] {
    const map = new Map<number, number>();

    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        const complement = target - nums[i];

        if (map.has(complement)) {
            return [map.get(complement)!, i];
        }

        map.set(nums[i], i);
    }

    // This should never be reached given the problem constraints
    return [];
}
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) - We traverse the array once
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) - In the worst case, we store all n elements in the hash map

### Why This Approach?

1. **Optimal Time:** The hash map lookup is O(1), making the overall solution O(n) instead of O(n²) with a brute force approach
2. **Single Pass:** We only need to iterate through the array once
3. **Clear Logic:** The complement check makes the solution easy to understand

### Test Cases

```typescript
// Test case 1: Basic example
twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9); // [0, 1]

// Test case 2: Different indices
twoSum([3, 2, 4], 6); // [1, 2]

// Test case 3: Same number twice
twoSum([3, 3], 6); // [0, 1]
```
