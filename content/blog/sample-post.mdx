# Why I Love TypeScript

TypeScript has become an essential tool in my development workflow. Here's why.

## Type Safety

TypeScript's type system catches errors at compile time, before they reach production. This saves hours of debugging and makes refactoring much safer.

```typescript
function calculateTotal(items: Item[]): number {
    return items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0);
}
```

## Better Developer Experience

With TypeScript, you get:
- **IntelliSense:** Autocomplete and inline documentation
- **Refactoring:** Rename symbols across your entire codebase safely
- **Documentation:** Types serve as inline documentation

## Gradual Adoption

You don't need to rewrite everything at once. TypeScript allows you to gradually add types to your JavaScript codebase.

## Conclusion

TypeScript isn't just about types—it's about building more maintainable, scalable applications with better tooling and developer experience.
