# Testing Strategy

- Follow current workflow: build/spec first, then add tests intentionally.
- When adding tests, focus on behavior and user-visible outcomes.
- Cover basics and edge cases first; avoid implementation-detail tests.
- Keep tests deterministic; mock only external boundaries.
- Prefer minimal, targeted test additions over broad speculative suites.
- Re-enable strict test gates only after core feature stabilization.
