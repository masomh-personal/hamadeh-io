# UI Library Policy

- Use a wrapper-first architecture under `components/ui`.
- Prefer Radix primitives as the headless foundation when needed.
- Keep component APIs consistent, simple, and project-owned.
- Avoid generator/copied patterns that reduce clarity or increase churn.
- Prioritize accessibility defaults (focus, keyboard, semantic roles).
- Use shared utilities (`cn`) and design tokens for styling consistency.
- Validate new components in the Components showcase page before wider use.
