# PR Title & Description Generator

When the user asks to "create PR title and description" (or similar), do the following — output in clean markdown for copy/paste, optimized for bookkeeping and future reference.

## Steps

1. Run `git fetch origin develop main` to ensure refs are current.
2. Run `git log origin/main..origin/develop --oneline` to get all commits.
3. Run `git diff origin/main...origin/develop --stat` to understand the scope of changes.

## Output format

Produce exactly this — nothing before or after:

```
## PR Title

\`\`\`
<concise conventional-commit-style title>
\`\`\`

## PR Description

\`\`\`markdown
## Summary

<2–4 sentences explaining the overall goal of this PR — what problem it solves, what was changed at a high level, and why. Write as if you're explaining to your future self 6 months from now.>

## Changes

### <Type> (e.g. Features, Bug Fixes, Refactoring, Styles, Chores)
- <scope>: <what changed and why it was needed — one line, but complete enough to be self-contained>

## Notes

<Optional: any caveats, follow-up work, known tradeoffs, or context that won't be obvious from the code. Omit this section entirely if there's nothing worth capturing.>
\`\`\`
```

## Rules

- Title must be conventional-commit style: `type: short imperative summary` or `type/type: ...` for mixed batches.
- The Summary section must be prose, not bullets — explain intent and context, not just what files changed.
- Group commits by conventional type (feat → Features, fix → Bug Fixes, refactor → Refactoring, style → Styles, docs → Documentation, chore → Chores).
- Each change bullet should say both what changed and why — enough context to be useful as a log entry.
- Omit any section with no commits of that type.
- Omit the Notes section if there's nothing meaningful to capture.
- No marketing language, no "this PR", no "I", no filler.
- Do NOT include a File Changes / diff stat block.
