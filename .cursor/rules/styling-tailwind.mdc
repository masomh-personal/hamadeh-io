# Styling and Tailwind Rules

- Use Tailwind utilities first; avoid custom CSS unless necessary.
- Use semantic design tokens/variables instead of hardcoded color values.
- Prefer `cn` for conditional class composition.
- Avoid arbitrary values unless reusable and documented.
- Keep responsive behavior mobile-first.
- Keep typography and spacing consistent with project design tokens.
