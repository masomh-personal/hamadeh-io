# Dependency and Tooling Policy

- Use Bun/Bunx for scripts and package operations in this repo.
- Keep lint/format on Biome; do not add ESLint/Prettier unless explicitly requested.
- Prefer per-repo dependencies over global installs.
- Do not add a new dependency without clear user benefit and justification.
- Prefer existing repo tooling and conventions before introducing alternatives.
- Keep lockfile and package manager usage consistent with the project standard.
- When changing tooling, update docs/scripts together to avoid drift.
