# TypeScript / React / Next.js Conventions

- Use strict TypeScript patterns and explicit boundaries for untrusted data.
- Exported functions should use explicit return types when practical.
- Prefer `interface` for public object contracts; use `type` for unions/aliases.
- Avoid enums; prefer `as const` objects/maps.
- Narrow types early and use exhaustive switches for unions.
- Default to React Server Components; keep client islands small.
- Minimize `useEffect` and unnecessary client state.
- Follow Next.js App Router patterns for routing, loading, and error states.
- Use semantic HTML by default.
