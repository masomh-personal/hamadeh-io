# hamadeh.io Core Standards

- Prioritize correctness, readability, and maintainability over cleverness.
- Keep changes minimal and scoped; avoid speculative features.
- Apply YAGNI, KISS, and DRY consistently.
- Prefer composition and pure functions over classes.
- Keep functions small, single-purpose, and predictable.
- Use comments to explain why, not what.
