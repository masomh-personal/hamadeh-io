# Repo Hygiene Rules

- Keep changes scoped; avoid unrelated refactors in the same pass.
- Never revert unrelated user changes without explicit request.
- Avoid destructive git operations unless explicitly approved.
- Run local checks after meaningful edits (`type-check` and `check`).
- Keep docs/config in sync when tooling, conventions, or major decisions change.
- Prefer small, verifiable steps and clear change summaries.
